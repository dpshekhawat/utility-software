### About

Have you ever faced the issue of cleaning your keyboard while keeping your laptop on? Because I faced it several times and to overcome it I wrote a simple python script which I call a keyboard blocking utility software for Windows. This useful tool allows users to temporarily disable their laptop keyboard, preventing accidental key presses while wiping down the keys. With this software, users can easily clean their keyboard without having to shut down their laptop or carefully clean each key individually. This can save time and make the cleaning process more efficient.

In addition to cleaning, there are other use cases, for instance:
- Preventing Accidental key presses by someone around you (kids, pets!!),
- (fun) pranking your friends/coworkers and watch them figure out. 

### How it works?

This keyboard blocking utility software for Windows operates as follows:

**System Tray Utility**

The software functions as a system tray utility, with an icon appearing in the system tray when the script is running in the background.

**Menu Options**

Right-clicking on the system tray icon reveals a menu with the following options:

(‚úÖ - working, üöß - under development) 
-  Block Keyboard‚úÖ: Selecting the ‚ÄúBlock keyboard‚Äù option temporarily disables the laptop keyboard.
-  Unblock Keyboard‚úÖ: Selecting the ‚ÄúUnblock keyboard‚Äù option re-enables the laptop keyboard.
-  Quit‚úÖ: Selecting the ‚ÄúQuit‚Äù option exits the utility software.

### More üöß:
- The keyboard hotkeys/shortcuts like (Ctrl+Shift+Esc, etc.) are not blocked using the script (will figure it out),
- Some Fn keys (multi-function keys) specifically F4,F5,F6 are not blocked (maybe because of the logic I used in script is not ideal)
